To monitor the battery and shutdown the pi automatically every time the Pi reboots, follow the steps below.

1) Save the python scripts you have downloaded in a folder called uptime (or any other name). We will use 
   uptime for this example. Note the path using the "pwd" command. We will assume the path for the folder is
   /home/pi/uptime and all the files are in that folder.
2) Edit the file /etc/rc.local - we assume you have your favorite editor (nano, vi, emacs etc.) Make sure
   you use sudo to edit the file. For example, using nano, the command will be "sudo nano /etc/rc.local"
3) Add the following 2 lines just before the last line in /etc/rc.local - the last line in the file is exit 0 

      # For Pi-UpTime 2.0 or for Pi-Z-UpTime 2.0
      sudo python /home/pi/uptime/uptime-2.0-rc-local.py &

      exit 0      #  <-- Note this is the last line in the file /etc/rc.local
4) Save the edited file /etc/rc.local and reboot


After reboot, the script is running in the background. No log messages are printed.

To monitor the operating conditions run the script uptime-2.0.py using command "python uptime2.0.py"
